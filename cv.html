                    <p>November 2015 to present
                    </p><hr>
                    <p>At <a href="https://sagittarius.agency/" target="_blank">Sagittarius</a> I have really grown into my role as a front-end developer; learning SASS and new CSS functions, as well as being introduced to Git using SourceTree, BitBucket and JIRA, which I use on a daily basis. Additionally on a day to day basis my current role involves me using powerful CMS's such as Sitecore and Umbraco, my knowledge and understanding of these CMS's have grown exponentially during my time at Sagittarius. Especially Sitecore as Sagittarius have multiple projects on this platform, and because of this I have been tasked with the creation and maintaining of projects in Sitecore.</p> 
                    <p>As I have progressed at Sagittarius, I have taken on much more responsibility including managing a small development team based in Ukraine, London &amp; Sri Lanka. My role also entails me to be proactive, which has resulted in myself being more involved in the build process from an earlier stage, in order to provide feedback from a technical perspective and raise any potential issues before they arise.</p>

                   <h4>Full Stack Web Developer</h4>
                   <p>January 2014 â€“ November 2015
                   </p><hr>
                   <p>After 1 year I progressed from being a Junior at Mission. This pushed me to have more responsibility, taking on tougher tasks and also being more involved with clients. My knowledge of both front and back end technologies grew. I started using Bootstrap and jQuery more frequently at this point and this is where my passion for client side technology came from. I was exploring client side options in near enough all my tasks, trying to improve the quality of my code.</p>

                   <p>January 2013 to January 2014
                   </p><hr>
                   <p>When I first started at <a href="http://www.mission-communications.net/" target="_blank">Mission Communications</a>, my day to day role was more learning the basics of C# and SQL development. I gained an initial understanding of how projects were built and I learnt a great deal of knowledge from my team members. I then took on learning more about HTML and CSS. This led to me getting small tasks to start me off and a few bigger projects along the way which I built from the back-end all the way client side.</p>

I also like exploring new front-end tech, which has led me to start beginner courses on Angular, React &amp; Vue.

In my down time, I am a gamer. </p>
